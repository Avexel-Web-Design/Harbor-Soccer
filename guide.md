üåê Harbor Soccer Program Website ‚Äì Design Plan
üé® Design Philosophy

    Creative but clean: Showcase energy and youthfulness through color, layout, and imagery, while maintaining the elegance of a classic serif typeface.

    Junicode serif: Lean into its scholarly, slightly historical character with well-balanced typography and spacing. Think vintage sports posters meets editorial layout.

    Visual metaphors: Use nautical/harbor elements subtly (e.g., wave dividers, compass-style icons) to reflect the ‚ÄúHarbor‚Äù theme.
